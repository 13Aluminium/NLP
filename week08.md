### **What is Lexical Semantics, and Why is it Important in NLP?**
Lexical semantics is the study of word meanings and the relationships between them. It examines how words convey meaning individually and in combination. In natural language processing (NLP), understanding lexical semantics is crucial for tasks such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, question answering, and text summarization, as it helps in interpreting and processing human language accurately.

### **Sense Relations vs. Syntagmatic Relations**
- **Sense Relations:** Focus on relationships between words based on meaning, such as synonymy (similar meaning) or antonymy (opposite meaning).  
  Example: *happy* and *joyful* (synonymy).  
- **Syntagmatic Relations:** Deal with how words combine in a sequence to create meaning (collocations or patterns).  
  Example: *drink water* versus *drink book*.  

---

### **Hyponymy and Hypernymy**
- **Hyponymy:** A "kind of" relationship where a specific term is a subset of a broader term.  
  Example: *Cat* (hyponym) is a type of *animal* (hypernym).  
- **Hypernymy:** The reverse, where the broader term encompasses specific subcategories.  
  Example: *Animal* is a hypernym for *cat, dog,* and *bird*.

### **Homonyms, Homophones, and Homographs**
- **Homonyms:** Words that sound the same or are spelled the same but have different meanings.  
  Example: *bat* (flying mammal) and *bat* (sports equipment).  
- **Homophones:** Words that sound the same but have different meanings and spellings.  
  Example: *flower* and *flour*.  
- **Homographs:** Words that are spelled the same but may have different pronunciations and meanings.  
  Example: *lead* (to guide) and *lead* (a metal).

### **Polysemy**
Polysemy refers to a single word having multiple related meanings.  
Example: *Bank* can mean the side of a river or a financial institution.  
In NLP, polysemy is handled using **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)** techniques that determine the correct sense based on context.

---

### **Synonymy and Antonymy**
- **Synonymy:** Words with similar meanings.  
  Example: *big* and *large*.  
- **Antonymy:** Words with opposite meanings.  
  Example: *hot* and *cold*.  
Lexical semantics uses these concepts for tasks like text simplification, paraphrasing, and sentiment analysis.

### **WordNet and Its Role in Lexical Semantic Analysis**
WordNet is a lexical database that organizes words into sets of synonyms (synsets) and defines semantic relationships like hypernymy, hyponymy, and meronymy. In NLP, WordNet is used for:  
- Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD).  
- Semantic similarity computation.  
- Query expansion in search engines.

---

### **Distributional Semantics**
Distributional semantics represents word meanings based on their contextual usage in large text corpora. It assumes that words with similar contexts have similar meanings. Methods like **Word2Vec**, **GloVe**, and **FastText** rely on distributional semantics to generate word embeddings.

### **Semantic Similarity and Its Applications**
Semantic similarity measures how closely related two words or sentences are in meaning. Applications include:  
- Information retrieval.  
- Plagiarism detection.  
- Text summarization.  
- Question answering.  

---

### **Role of Embeddings in Lexical Semantics**
Word embeddings capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words in vector space.  
- **Word2Vec:** Generates context-independent embeddings.  
- **GloVe:** Combines local and global context.  
- **FastText:** Considers subword information, useful for morphologically rich languages.  
Embeddings are essential for downstream NLP tasks like machine translation and sentiment analysis.

### **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging in Lexical Semantics**
POS tagging identifies the grammatical role of words in a sentence (e.g., noun, verb, adjective). This helps in:  
- Determining word meaning.  
- Disambiguating polysemous words.  
- Enabling syntactic parsing and dependency analysis.

---

### **Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)**
SRL identifies the roles played by words in a sentence, such as agent, action, or recipient.  
Example: In *"John sold a car to Mary,"*  
- *John* is the agent.  
- *a car* is the theme.  
- *Mary* is the recipient.  
Applications include question answering and machine comprehension.

---

### **Lexical Ambiguity and Its Resolution**
Lexical ambiguity occurs when a word has multiple meanings.  
Example: *"The bank is by the river"* (financial institution vs. riverbank).  
Resolution methods:  
- **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD):** Uses context to determine the correct sense.  
- **Contextual Embeddings:** Models like BERT use surrounding text to resolve ambiguity.

---

### **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)**
WSD determines the correct sense of a word based on its context.  
Challenges:  
- Fine-grained distinctions in word meanings.  
- Lack of annotated datasets for specific domains.  
Approaches:  
- Supervised learning with labeled data.  
- Knowledge-based methods using resources like WordNet.

---

### **Using Lexical Resources for WSD**
Lexical resources like WordNet assist in WSD by providing:  
- Sense definitions and examples.  
- Semantic relationships (e.g., synonyms, hypernyms).  
Methods include:  
- **Lesk Algorithm:** Matches context words with WordNet glosses.  
- **Path-Based Similarity:** Computes similarity based on semantic distance in WordNet.
